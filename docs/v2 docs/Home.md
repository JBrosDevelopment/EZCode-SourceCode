# Welcome to the EZCode Wiki

### Overview

Welcome to the official documentation for EZCode, a powerful programming language designed to make coding easy and efficient. This wiki serves as a comprehensive resource for developers, providing detailed information on the language, its features, and how to use it effectively. 

### Files

EZCode's supported file extensions are _.ezcode_ and _.ezproj_. The _ezcode_ extension should have EZCode in it with its specific syntax. The _ezproj_ has the EZProject Syntax that acts as the entry part for the program.

### Syntax

EZCode has simple syntax designed to make coding easy. There are two sets of syntax, the main one being [EZCode](EZCode-Docs). The second syntax is [EZProj](EZProject-Docs). 

### Programs

There are many programs that make up EZCode. To make it simple and prevent any errors, [EZCode Installer](https://github.com/JBrosDevelopment/EZCode/releases/latest) was created to download the necessary programs and give optional installation for other programs. One of the programs (Test Environment) isn't on the Installer because it isn't made for just any user. If that is something that you might like to install, download it directly from GitHub yourself! The current list of the programs available to download from the [Installer](Programs#installer) are: [EZ Player](Programs#ezplayer), [SLN Builder](Programs#sln-builder), and the [EZ Integrated Development Environment (IDE).](Programs#ez-ide)

### API

The EZCode API can be found in the [API Docs](API-Docs).

### Website

You can find EZCode at [The Official EZCode Website](https://ez-code.web.app). You can also find it on the [JBros Development Page](https://jbros-development.web.app/ezcode.html).
